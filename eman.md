# Emmanuel's Contributions to the Vaper Project

## Overview

This document outlines my comprehensive contributions to the Vaper project, covering both frontend and backend development. The project is a modern web application for vaporizer recommendations, featuring an AI-powered recommendation engine, interactive quizzes, and a robust admin interface.

## Backend Contributions

### High-Level Architecture

I designed and implemented a modular backend architecture using **NestJS**, with a clear separation of concerns:

- **Modular Design**: Created distinct modules (`AuthModule`, `VaporizerModule`, `QuizModule`), each encapsulating a specific domain of functionality.
- **Type-Safe Database Operations**: Implemented **Prisma** as the ORM for fully type-safe interactions with the PostgreSQL database, eliminating a wide class of runtime errors.
- **Configuration Management**: Developed a centralized `config.ts` to handle environment variables, providing a single source of truth for application configuration.

### Authentication & Security (`auth` module)

I implemented a robust, security-first authentication system using **Passport.js**:

- **Core Strategy**: Employed JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication.
- **Login Flow (`LocalStrategy`)**:
  1. Developed `AuthService.validateUser` to securely compare user passwords with hashed passwords using `bcrypt`.
  2. Created `AuthService.login` to generate JWTs containing the `userId` and `username`.
- **Secure JWT Handling (`JwtStrategy`)**:
  - **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Implemented secure, `httpOnly` cookies to store JWTs, mitigating XSS attacks by making tokens inaccessible to client-side JavaScript.
  - **Automated Token Extraction**: Configured the `JwtStrategy` to automatically extract JWTs from cookies, validate signatures and expiration, and attach user objects to requests.
- **Route Protection**: Implemented `@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)` for declarative route protection.

### Vaporizer Module (`vaporizer` module)

I developed the core module of the application:

- **`VaporizerController`**: Created a full suite of RESTful endpoints (`/api/vaporizers`) for vaporizer management, handling request/response cycles, parameter parsing, and DTO validation.
- **`VaporizerService`**: Implemented core business logic for all CRUD operations, with direct Prisma client interaction and proper error handling.
- **Image Uploads (`operations/upload.ts`)**: Developed the `uploadVaporizerImage` function to handle file uploads via `multer`, store images in a dedicated **Supabase Storage** bucket, and update database records with public URLs.
- **Annotations (`AnnotationService`, `dto/create-annotation.dto.ts`)**: Created a system for user-generated annotations with strict validation using **Zod**.

### AI Recommendation Engine

I designed and implemented the platform's flagship feature:

- **Core Logic (`vaporizer/recommendation.ts`)**: Created the `recommendVaporizersByVibe` function to:
  1. Construct detailed prompts for the LLM to extract key descriptive terms from user "vibe" inputs.
  2. Handle LLM interactions efficiently.
  3. Parse responses, generate "vibe vectors," and perform cosine similarity searches against pre-computed vaporizer vectors.
- **Provider-Agnostic LLM Service (`lib/llm`)**: Developed a flexible service using the **Factory Pattern**:
  - **`LlmClient` (`client.ts`)**: Created a factory class to instantiate appropriate concrete clients based on provider names.
  - **`GeminiClient` (`gemini.ts`)**: Implemented a concrete client for Google's Gemini Pro, handling API interactions and response formatting.
  - **Shared Interfaces (`types.ts`)**: Defined common interfaces to enforce consistent contracts across all LLM clients.

### Quiz Module (`quiz` module)

I built an interactive, stateful system for user recommendations:

- **`QuizController`**: Created RESTful endpoints for quiz management, including starting quizzes, retrieving questions, submitting answers, and getting results.
- **`QuizService`**: Implemented complex business logic for:
  - **State Management**: Tracking quiz session progress, answers, and scores.
  - **Dynamic Flow**: Creating branching logic based on user responses.
  - **Result Calculation**: Computing final outcomes and leveraging the recommendation engine for suitable vaporizer suggestions.

### Infrastructure & Shared Libraries (`lib` module)

I established core infrastructure components:

- **`supabase.ts`**: Created a singleton instance of the Supabase client with secure credential management.
- **`multer.ts`**: Developed a reusable `multer` configuration with security-conscious settings for file handling.

## Frontend Contributions

### Home Page Experience

I developed a user-friendly landing page (`HomePage.tsx`) that offers two main recommendation flows:

- **Guided Quiz**: An interactive questionnaire that leads users through a series of questions to determine their preferences.
- **Vibe-Based Recommendations**: A natural language interface where users can describe their mood or situation in their own words.

Both options feature:
- Animated UI components using **Framer Motion** for enhanced user experience
- Loading states with custom spinners to provide visual feedback
- Seamless navigation using **React Router**

### Admin Interface

I created a comprehensive admin dashboard with several key components:

#### Quiz Management System

- **`QuizEditor.tsx`**: A modal interface for creating and editing quizzes with:
  - Tab-based navigation between quiz settings and questions
  - Form controls for quiz metadata (title, description, status)
  - Integration with the question editor

- **`QuestionEditor.tsx`**: A sophisticated editor for quiz questions supporting:
  - Multiple question types (welcome screens, single/multiple choice, ranking, range sliders)
  - Dynamic form fields based on question type
  - Drag-and-drop option reordering
  - Expandable/collapsible question cards for better UX

- **`QuizPreview.tsx`**: A real-time preview component showing how quizzes will appear to users

#### Product Management

- **`ProductManagementCard.tsx`**: A visually appealing card component for vaporizer products with:
  - Status indicators (active, pending, rejected)
  - Stock availability visualization
  - Condition badges with appropriate color coding
  - Quick action buttons for viewing, editing, approving, and deleting products

#### Dashboard Components

- **`ActivityFeed.tsx`**: A real-time feed of user activities and system events
- **`RevenueChart.tsx`**: Data visualization for sales and revenue metrics
- **`StatsCard.tsx`**: Compact information cards displaying key performance indicators
- **`UserManagementCard.tsx`**: Interface for managing user accounts and permissions

### Custom Hooks and Utilities

- **`useVibeRecommendation`**: A custom React hook that interfaces with the backend recommendation engine, handling API calls, loading states, and error management for the vibe-based recommendation feature.

### UI/UX Improvements

- Implemented a consistent design language across the application using **Tailwind CSS**
- Created responsive layouts that work well on both desktop and mobile devices
- Added micro-interactions and animations to enhance user engagement
- Designed intuitive navigation patterns for both users and administrators

## Technical Highlights

- **Full-Stack TypeScript**: Maintained type safety across the entire application stack
- **Modern React Patterns**: Utilized hooks, context, and functional components
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application works seamlessly across device sizes
- **API Integration**: Created robust interfaces between frontend and backend services
- **State Management**: Implemented efficient state handling for complex UI components
- **Security Best Practices**: Applied authentication, authorization, and data validation throughout
